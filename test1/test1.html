                            <p>Mount Everest (Chinese: 珠穆朗玛 Zhūmùlǎngmǎ; Nepali: सगरमाथा, romanized: Sagarmāthā;
                                Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located
                                in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across
                                its summit point.[5] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031.7 ft) was most
                                recently established in 2020 by the Nepali and Chinese authorities.[6]

                                Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There
                                are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal
                                (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing
                                substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents
                                dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as significant hazards
                                from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall. As of 2019, over 300 people have died on
                                Everest,[7] many of whose bodies remain on the mountain.[8]

                                The first recorded efforts to reach Everest's summit were made by British mountaineers.
                                As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time, the British made
                                several attempts on the north ridge route from the Tibetan side. After the first
                                reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921 reached 7,000 m (22,970 ft) on the
                                North Col, the 1922 expedition pushed the north ridge route up to 8,320 m (27,300 ft),
                                marking the first time a human had climbed above 8,000 m (26,247 ft). The 1924
                                expedition resulted in one of the greatest mysteries on Everest to this day: George
                                Mallory and Andrew Irvine made a final summit attempt on 8 June but never returned,
                                sparking debate as to whether or not they were the first to reach the top. Tenzing
                                Norgay and Edmund Hillary made the first official ascent of Everest in 1953, using the
                                southeast ridge route. Norgay had reached 8,595 m (28,199 ft) the previous year as a
                                member of the 1952 Swiss expedition. The Chinese mountaineering team of Wang Fuzhou,
                                Gonpo, and Qu Yinhua made the first reported ascent of the peak from the north ridge on
                                25 May 1960.[9]</p>
